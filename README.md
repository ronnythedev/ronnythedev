### Hey there!

I'm Ronny, a passionate Software Engineer hailing from the vibrant landscape of Costa Rica üá®üá∑.

With over two decades of experience in the IT industry, I've witnessed the evolution of technology firsthand, having embarked on my journey back in '99 when the Internet was still in its nascent stages.

I vividly recall my humble beginnings as a junior developer, armed with nothing but my determination and a trusty [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Visual-Basic-6-0-Programmers/dp/1572318635), alongside the faithful companion of an English dictionary. It was during those formative years, amidst the challenges and triumphs, that I cultivated my love for crafting code and solving problems.

Join me as I continue to traverse the ever-changing landscape of software development, embracing innovation while cherishing the timeless principles that have guided me since the beginning.

## About Me

- üõ†Ô∏è Currently, I'm immersed in: Migrating APIs to .NET 8 on the backend and embracing Next.js for frontend development.
- üå≥ I'm delving deeper into: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles, focusing on building rich domains, while also exploring Modular Monolith Architecture with sufficient flexibility for future migration to Microservices. Additionally, I'm exploring Algorithms and Data Structures (A&DS).
- üî• Next on my learning agenda: I'm eager to delve further into Test-Driven Development (TDD) and enhancing my skills in frontend testing.

## Tools I Like To Use

- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)
  - **Why?** ASP.NET is a robust framework for building enterprise-scale web applications and services, now available cross-platform. It's versatile and backed by Microsoft's reliability.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - **Why?** Leveraging JavaScript with Node.js and its powerful V8 engine enables me to build flexible backends. I appreciate the language consistency between frontend and backend development.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
  - **Why?** Express simplifies Node.js backend development with its rich feature set, particularly its HTTP utility methods.

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - **Why?** React's virtual DOM improves web app performance and enhances code maintainability. It revolutionized frontend development by integrating HTML into JavaScript.

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
  - **Why?** Building on my React.js knowledge, React Native allows me to develop hybrid apps efficiently once I've mastered its learning curve and deployment process.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - **Why?** Next.js streamlines development by managing package versions and providing server-side rendering (SSR). Its opinionated framework approach ensures project stability and scalability.

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
  - **Why?** JavaScript's flexibility and ubiquity make it indispensable for frontend development, enriching user experience and powering leading frontend frameworks.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - **Why?** Depending on project size, TypeScript's strong typing catches errors before compilation, enhancing code reliability and scalability.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
  - **Why?** As the world's most advanced open-source relational database, PostgreSQL offers robust data normalization crucial for large-scale enterprise projects.

- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server)
  - **Why?** SQL Server seamlessly integrates with .NET and Entity Framework, providing a powerful relational database solution for various applications.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - **Why?** MongoDB offers flexibility for projects prioritizing speed over strict relationships, utilizing collections and documents for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
  - **Why?** Mongoose simplifies MongoDB interaction with schemas and standard methods, abstracting away complexity and enhancing developer productivity.

- [Entity Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx)
  - **Why?** Entity Framework's ORM capabilities streamline interaction with relational databases, supporting multiple database providers and simplifying data access in .NET applications.
