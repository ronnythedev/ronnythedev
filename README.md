### Hello World!! 😃 🌎 

I'm Ronny. A Software Engineer based in Costa Rica 🇨🇷

I've been in the IT industry since '99. I started developing when Internet was not what is now. 

In my first job as a junior developer I took advantage of what I learned by myself during High School with [this](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Visual-Basic-6-0-Programmers/dp/1572318635) book and an English dictionary.

## About Me

- 🛠️ I'm currently working on: Migrating services and webapps to .NET 6 (backend) and to Next.js (frontend).
- 🌳 I'm currently learning: Typescript and Next.js.
- 🔥 What I want to learn next: Jest (for frontend tests) and keep improving my CQRS architecture in .NET 6 (backend). Also, I will start a small project to help people to overcome [emetophobia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4253364/#:~:text=A%20disproportionate%20fear%20of%20vomiting,is%20fairly%20difficult%20to%20treat.) and I will translate (multilanguage support) my small MERN [project](https://www.myplanapp.info/).

- 😝 Fun fact: in High School I played the guitar 🎸 in a trio... And we made money!
